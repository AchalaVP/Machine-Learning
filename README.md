#  Machine Learning Repository


##### Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository is dedicated to storing all the machine learning codes and projects that I practice and execute as a beginner 

## About

##### As I embark on my journey to learn machine learning, this repository will serve as a central hub for all my hands-on projects and experiments. Each project will be organized in its own directory, containing the code, dataset, and any necessary documentation or Jupyter Notebooks.
