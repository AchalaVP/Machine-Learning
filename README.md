Machine Learning Repository


Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository is dedicated to storing all the machine learning codes and projects that I practice and execute as a beginner in the exciting world of data science and artificial intelligence.

About
As I embark on my journey to learn machine learning, this repository will serve as a central hub for all my hands-on projects and experiments. Each project will be organized in its own directory, containing the code, dataset, and any necessary documentation or Jupyter Notebooks.
